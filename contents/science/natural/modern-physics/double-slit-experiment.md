#### notes

- double-slit experiment => width of the bands = function of frequency
- light => diffraction => it's wave, photoelectric => it's particle
- electron & neutron & ... => double-slit diffraction => it's wave
- even individual electron acts as wave in double-slit, interfers with itself
- to show diffraction, matter should pass slits the size of its wavelength
