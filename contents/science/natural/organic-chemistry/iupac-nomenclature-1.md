#### notes

- saturated = only single bond
- condensed formula => too long for big compounds
- vertex = carbon atom
- hydrogens are implied
- nomenclature is completely conventional
- naming rules
    - suffix
        - longest chain = -ane
        - substituent = -yl
    - prefix
    - numbering direction => lower substituent number
    - naming order
        -  substituents first
