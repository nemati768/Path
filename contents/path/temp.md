Compare human production scale (cell phones per year, smaller than that, batteries per year, or even smaller, the most smallest peiece) with natures production rate and scale (cells per year). Just multiply 50 billion cells per day for each person by 8 billion population of the Earth.

Nature wins.

There are a lot of misunderstanding in man-to-man communication. And the reason is that we don't know everything about the other party. We don't know the intention.
Yet there is no misunderstanding when it comes to communicating with the God. Because he knows everything, even intentions, and even things that we don't know about outselves.
